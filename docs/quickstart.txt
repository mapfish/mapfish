Quickstart
**********

A 20-minute quickstart to get a good sense of what MapFish is and what MapFish
provides.

With this quickstart you'll understand how to create a MapFish application, a
basic user interface based on the JavaScript libraries provided by MapFish, and
MapFish web services.

Installation
------------

Follow the instructions of the `installation page <installation.html>`_ and
come back here once done. Make sure the virtual Python environment is activated
before you proceed with the next section.

Creating the application
------------------------

Here you're going to use the framework to create your first MapFish
application.

Generating the base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use::

    (env) $ paster create -t mapfish MapFishApp

``MapFishApp`` is the name of the MapFish application you're creating, you can
pick any name of your choice. We'll assume that you choose ``MapFishApp`` in
the rest of this quickstart.

When asked what template engine to use answer ``mako``, which is the default.
When asked if SQLAlchemy 0.6 configuration is to be included, answer ``True``,
as your MapFish application will include web services relying on database
tables.

You should now have a folder named ``MapFishApp``. This folder contains your
application files.

Now check that your MapFish application works. For this go into the
``MapFishApp`` folder and start the application::

    (env) $ cd MapFishApp
    (env) $ paster serve development.ini

This command starts your application in the Paster web server, which is a
pure-Python web server commonly used during development.

Open http://localhost:5000 in your web browser, you should get the default
page:

    :height: 300pt
    :width: 500pt

Installing the JavaScript toolbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are now going to install the MapFish JavaScript toolbox in your
application. This toolbox includes:

* the ExtJS, OpenLayers, GeoExt JavaScript libraries,
* a sample JavaScript application based on those libraries,
* a build profile for minifying the JavaScript code of this sample
  application,
* a JavaScript testing framework, with a test example

Installing the JavaScript toolbox is done by applying the ``mapfish_client``
template.

.. warning::

    Version 0.2 of ``mapfish.plugin.client``, which is the Python package
    providing the ``mapfish_client`` template, includes versions of OpenLayers
    and GeoExt that don't work with FireFox 4 and later when the JavaScript
    code is not built.

    You can list the content of ``env/lib/python2.5/site-packages`` to know
    what version of ``mapfish.plugin.client`` is in use.

Enter ``Ctrl+C`` to stop the Paster server and proceed with these
commands::

    (env) $ cd ..
    (env) $ paster create -t mapfish_client MapFishApp

When asked whether to overwrite ``index.html`` answer ``y``. This will
overwrite the ``index.html`` page you saw in the last section by the one
provided by the ``mapfish_client`` template. When asked whether to overwrite
``favicon.png`` also answer ``y``.

Start the application again::

    (env) $ cd MapFishApp
    (env) $ paster serve --reload development.ini

.. note::
    Note the use of the ``--reload`` switch. This switch makes the Paste server
    monitor all Python modules used by the ``MapFishApp`` application and
    reload itself automatically if any of them is modified or if new modules
    are created. This is especially useful during development.

Open or reload http://localhost:5000 in your web browser, you should now get
the default user interface:

.. image:: _static/osm.png
    :height: 300pt
    :width: 500pt

This default user interface is composed of: a map, a toolbar above the map with
tools acting on the map, and a layer tree for controlling the visibility of
layers. The map itself is composed of two `OpenStreetMap
<http://openstreetmap.org>`_ layers.

The default user interface is provided to the application developer as an
example. The application developer is free to build on it, or delete it to
write his own if he wants.

Creating a web service
----------------------

MapFish provides a command for generating web services implementing the
`MapFish Protocol <protocol.html>`_. A MapFish web service relies on
geographic database table.

.. note::
    In this tutorial PostgreSQL/PostGIS is used as database, but you can
    also use other database systems, see :doc:`framework/spatial-databases` 
    for further information.

Before creating web services you need to set up the connection to the
geographic database. For this quickstart an existing public database will be
used, but you can also set up your own database (see :doc:`framework/spatial-databases`). 
In real-life scenarios, the database system and the MapFish application execute 
on the same host or on hosts of the same private network.

To set up the database connection edit ``development.ini`` and replace the line
::

    sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///%(here)s/development.db

by this one::

    sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://quickstart:quickstart@www.mapfish.org:5432/quickstart

The connection string specifies that the ``postgresql`` driver must be used, the
database system is located at ``www.mapfish.org`` on port ``5432``, and the
name of the database is ``quickstart``.

Now that the database connection is set up, you're ready to create the web
service. Creating a web service is done in three steps:

1. create a layer configuration in the ``layers.ini`` file, in our case we're
   going rely on the table named ``countries`` in the database, so the
   configuration is::

        [countries]
        singular=country
        plural=countries
        table=countries
        epsg=4326
        geomcolumn=the_geom
        geomtype=MultiPolygon

   ``singular`` provides a ``singular`` name for the layer. ``plural`` provides
   a plural name for the layer. Both are used by the code generator when
   substituting variables. ``table`` provides the name of the database.
   ``epsg`` provides the coordinate system of the table data. ``geomcolumn``
   provides the name of the geometry column and ``geomtype`` the geometry type.
   Further information about the ``layer.ini`` configuration can be found in the
   `framework documentation <framework/webservice.html#layer-ini-2-0>`_.

2. generate the web service code with the ``mf-layer`` command::

    (env) $ paster mf-layer countries

3. configure a route to the ``countries`` controller, this is done by adding
   the following lines after the "CUSTOM ROUTES HERE" comment in the
   ``mapfishapp/config/routing.py`` file::

    map.connect("/countries/count", controller="countries", action="count")
    map.resource("country", "countries")

Watch the indentation! 4 spaces are needed here.

If you stopped ``paster serve`` or if you did not add the ``--reload`` switch,
restart ``MapFishApp`` with::

    (env) $ paster serve --reload development.ini

You can now open http://localhost:5000/countries?limit=1 in your browser, you
should see a `GeoJSON <http://geojson.org>`_ representation of the first object
in the ``countries`` table:

    :width: 500pt

Creating search functionality
-----------------------------

Now that the ``countries`` web service works, let's create a search
functionality based on that web service. This search functionality will involve
displaying a popup containing information about the country that is clicked by
the user.

Edit the ``mapfishapp/public/app/lib/App/layout.js`` file, look up the
``createTbarItems()`` function, and insert a new ``GeoExt.Action`` to the array
returned by the function by adding the following code to the function (If
unsure, see this :download:`file <_static/layout.js>`):

.. code-block:: javascript

    actions.push(new GeoExt.Action({
        text: "Query",
        map: map,
        toggleGroup: "tools",
        allowDepress: false,
        control: new OpenLayers.Control.GetFeature({
    	protocol: new OpenLayers.Protocol.HTTP({
    	    url: "countries",
    	    params: {
    		epsg: "900913",
    		attrs: "pays,continent"
    	    },
    	    format: new OpenLayers.Format.GeoJSON()
    	}),
    	eventListeners: {
    	    featureselected: function(e) {
    		var f = e.feature;
    		var html = "<p>Country: "+f.attributes.pays+"</p>" +
    		    "<p>Continent: "+f.attributes.continent+"</p>";
    		f.geometry.transform(
    		    map.displayProjection, map.projection);
    		if (!this._popup) {
    		    this._popup = new GeoExt.Popup({
    			html: html,
    			map: map,
    			closeAction: 'hide',
    			unpinnable: false
    		    });
    		}
    		else {
    		    this._popup.body.update(html);
    		    this._popup.doLayout();
    		}
    		this._popup.feature = f;
    		this._popup.show();
    	    }
    	}
        })
    }));

In the above code a ``GeoExt.Action`` configured with an
``OpenLayers.Control.GetFeature`` is added to the array of actions. The
``OpenLayers.Control.GetFeature`` object is connected to the ``countries`` web
service through an ``OpenLayers.Protocol.HTTP`` object. In this example a
``GeoExt.Popup`` containing the name of the clicked country, and the name of
the continent, is displayed.
